## Week 1 (May 05 - 10):
  - [ ] Do any necessary work on [https://github.com/appleseedhq/appleseed/pull/2811](https://github.com/appleseedhq/appleseed/pull/2811).
  - [x] Compare results of [https://github.com/appleseedhq/appleseed/pull/2811](https://github.com/appleseedhq/appleseed/pull/2811) with other renderer engines.
  - [x] Investigate Hosek and Wilkie Solar disk implementin.
  - [x] Investigate Other Renderers solar disk implementin.

## Week 2 (May 11 - 17):
  - [ ] Finish Solar disk implementation from [Hosek's paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262149273_Adding_a_Solar-Radiance_Function_to_the_Hosek-Wilkie_Skylight_Model)
  - [ ] Clean code and open a pull request.
  
## Week 3 (May 18 - 24):
  - [ ] Add features to visible solar disk
    - [ ] Limb Darkening.
    - [ ] Red Flash.
    - [ ] Mirages.

## Week 4 (May 25 - 31): 
  - [ ] Finish solar disk implementation.
  - [ ] Add ability to tint sun and aky.
  - [ ] Start research and implement algorithm to configure sun and sky with a geographic location and date.
  
## Week 5 and 6 (June 01 - 14):
  - [ ] Implement algorithm to configure sun and sky with a geographic location and date
  - [ ] Clean implemented code.
  
## Week 7 (June 15 - 21):
  - Start to extend the model to render ExoPlanets Scenes.
    - [ ] Implement the ability to rescaling wavelengths to match a different star radiance.
    - [ ] Extend the model to scenarios that involve more than one star.

## Week 8 (June 22 - 28):
  - [ ] Create Test scenes.
  
## Week 9 (June 29 - 05):
  - [ ] Investigate the algorithm that Preethan and Hosek models use to generate theirdata and the necessary modification in their algorithms.

## Week 10 (July 06 - 12):
  - [ ] Work on report to phase 1 evalutaion.
  - [ ] Investigate and discuss with Apple Seed develop about the best way to add the algorithms to Appleseed

## Week 11 (July 13 - 25):
  - [ ] Implement the algorithms to generate the Hosek data.
  
## Week 13 (July 26 - 02):
  - [ ] Create a test scene using the Mars atmosphere data.
  - [ ] Start to implement an algorithm to generate Preethan data. (probability very similar to how Hosek does)

## Week 13 (August 03 - 09):
  - [ ] Cleaning up the code.
  - [ ] Work on report to phase 2 evalutaion.
  - [ ] Create test scenes for different planets.
  
## Week 13 (August 10 - 16):
  - [ ] Make sure all features are working fine in all Appleseed plugins 
  
## Week 13 (August 17 - 24):
  - [ ] Work on final evaluation.
