title: [Gsoc Revisiting Physical Sun and Sky Model]
description: [This project will improve the current Appleseed's implementation of physical sun and sky models. Fixing the current blue tint present on Appleseed implementation and adding several new features. Such as, a solar disk, ability to configure the Sun with a geographic location, a date and a time and allow users to change atmosphere parameters. Those new features will make the sky models more flexible for artists and will provide a more accurate representation of the appearance and illumination from the day sky. The new features will also make it possible to render other planets skies, from a physically plausible mars sky to an alien sky with multiple suns and a stunning sky's color.]
